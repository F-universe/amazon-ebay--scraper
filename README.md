Flask Amazon & eBay Scraper
This project creates a web application using Flask, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to search for products simultaneously on Amazon and eBay. Users can enter a product query and view results from both platforms on a single page. The results include product names, prices, and images.

Features
This scraper has the following functionalities:

Search for products on Amazon.it and eBay.com simultaneously.
Display search results for each platform in separate sections, with details like product name, price, and image.
Up to 7 pages of Amazon results and an unlimited number of eBay pages can be fetched.
Supports pagination for both platforms.
Requirements
To run this project, the following are required:

Python 3.x for running the code.
Flask for handling web requests and rendering the frontend.
Selenium for automating browser actions during web scraping.
BeautifulSoup4 for parsing HTML content on eBay.
Chrome WebDriver for interacting with Google Chrome.
Installation
Clone the repository by downloading or using a version control tool to retrieve the project code from GitHub.

Navigate into the project folder where the app.py and other code files are stored.

Ensure that you have all the required dependencies installed. These can be installed using Pythonâ€™s package manager (pip), and the packages needed are Flask, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. You will also need to install Chrome and ChromeDriver, updating the paths in the code for chromedriver_path and chrome_path accordingly.

Running the Project
To run the project, execute the Python file that contains the Flask application. This will launch a local web server, and you can access the application in your web browser at the local address (typically http://127.0.0.1:5000/). Once the app is running, you can search for any product and view results from Amazon and eBay side by side.

Project Structure
app.py: Contains the main logic for the web scraping operations and the Flask routes.
templates/: Stores the HTML templates for rendering the search form and displaying the search results.
Dependencies
Flask: A micro web framework for Python, used to handle HTTP requests and serve the user interface.
Selenium: A web automation tool used here for interacting with Amazon and eBay search pages.
BeautifulSoup: A library used for parsing HTML, specifically for scraping product data from eBay.
Concurrent Futures: A Python module for managing concurrent execution, used to fetch Amazon and eBay data simultaneously.
Limitations and Known Issues
Product information such as price or image may not always be available, and when unavailable, the text "N/A" will be shown.
There may be some delays when navigating through multiple pages, especially when dealing with Amazon's privacy settings or CAPTCHA.
